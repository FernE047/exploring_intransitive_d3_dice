chance of getting a intransitive 2-sided 3-diceset: 0/3 = 0.00%
chance of getting a intransitive 3-sided 3-diceset: 5/280  = 1.79%

problem VI: given three 4-sided dice A, B, C, the probability will they form an intransitive diceset will be higher or lower than the 3-sided case? 
chance of getting a intransitive 4-sided 3-diceset: 13/5775 = 0.22510822%

problem VII: given three N-sided dice A, B, C, how does the probability of them forming an intransitive diceset change as N increases?
conjecture: as N increases, the probability of getting an intransitive diceset decreases. because the number of possible comparison arrangements increases much faster than the number of intransitive arrangements.
