observations:

given 2 random dice there's a probability of 50% that you can find a third die that makes the diceset intransitive. because if we ignore the equality cases, there's only 10 possible comparison arrangements between two dice, and 5 of them can become intransitive with a third die.
given 3 random dice there's a probability of 5/280=1.7857% that they are intransitive. this is because there are 280 possible comparison arrangements between three dice without equality, and only 5 of them are intransitive.
given 4 random dice there's a probability of 99.97% that at if you pick 2 dice from them, you can find a third die that makes the diceset intransitive. Probability being 1 - (1 - 1/2)^C(4,2) = 99.975585%
given 7 random dice you are almost certain to be able to find 3 dice that form an intransitive diceset. Probability being 1 - (1 - 5/280)^C(7,3) = 99.99997328%
