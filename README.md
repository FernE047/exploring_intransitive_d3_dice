This repository contains informal research notes and brute-force experiments
related to 3-sided intransitive dice.

**Initial Problem:** Given any set of two 3-sided dice, can you add a third one that makes them intransitive?

**Status:** Work in progress, not peer-reviewed.

- `data/`: Output files

**Disclaimer:** This is exploratory work. I am not a graduated mathematician, just a recreational mathematician trying to organize her thoughts.
